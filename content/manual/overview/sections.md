# Shopping Experiences Section for Free Layout Design

A common problem with Shopware sections is their rigidity, which offers users little opportunity to design layouts freely and responsively. Often, there are only pseudo-layout blocks that provide pre-made layouts and, in most cases, are not very customizable.

With the Elysium sections, you can dynamically adjust the width of each block by dragging the mouse pointer. You can also set the visual order and merge block rows. Within the section, you have grid options such as block alignment or the spacing of the gap. The best part is that many settings can be adjusted separately for the smartphone, tablet, or desktop view.

Elysium sections are seamlessly integrated into the Shopping Experience editor and offer maximum compatibility, even with third-party Shopping Experience elements. This feature is available from Elysium version 3.6.
