# Create appealing and reusable slides

With the Slide Builder, you can create appealing and reusable slides. These slides can be arranged in your Shopping Experience layouts using the Slider or Banner element. The Slide Builder allows you to create both simple "Image only" banners and complex SEO banners. Even without knowledge of graphic programs or programming skills, you can create appealing banners.

If you have basic knowledge of Twig, the Shopware template system, and CSS, you can create your own slide templates as a Twig file and implement a slide exactly according to the given requirements. Additionally, you can extend slides with custom fields to make them even more versatile.
