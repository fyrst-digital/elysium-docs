## Mobile-first approach and device-dependent settings
Elysium offers device-dependent settings that can be adjusted for smartphone, tablet, and desktop views. The mobile-first approach is consistently followed. Settings are inherited from the smartphone view to all other views. This means that device-dependent settings do not need to be maintained separately for each view, with only a few exceptions.

On the following pages, you will get an overview of the core features of Elysium.
