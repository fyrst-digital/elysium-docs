To change the settings of a section, go to the layout icon displayed to the left of the section. This will open the sidebar with the default settings of the section. Click on the layout icon in the sidebar to open the Elysium section settings. In these settings, you can adjust the horizontal alignment of the blocks, the spacing between the blocks, and the outer margins of the section. These settings are device-dependent and can be set separately for smartphone, tablet, and desktop.

<Grid>
    <Column :cols="{xs: 12, '6xl': 10}" :col-start="{'6xl': 2}">

        :sizes="{xs: 200, lg: 600, '6xl': 800}" :lazy="false" />
    </Column>
</Grid>

**Block Alignment** sets the vertical alignment of all blocks in the section.  
- **Stretch** adjusts all blocks in a section to the same height.
- **Start** aligns the blocks at the start of a section.
- **End** aligns the blocks at the end of a section.
- **Center** aligns the blocks in the middle of a section.

The **spacing** of a section can be adjusted. You can set the horizontal and vertical spacing of the section, as well as the spacing between the blocks.

## Change Breakpoint per Section

There is also the option to adjust breakpoints per section. Breakpoints determine at which screen width the view in the theme should take effect.
