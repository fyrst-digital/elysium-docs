## Link slide and set size
Under **Select Slide**, you can link a slide that will be displayed as a single banner. If the **Automatic Size** option is enabled, the banner is flexible in height and adjusts to the content.

Alternatively, you can set an **Aspect Ratio** and a **Maximum Height** that should not be exceeded. The automatic size, aspect ratio, and maximum height are device-dependent.

## Lazy loading of slide covers and focus images

**Lazy loading** is enabled by default and uses the browser's lazy loading function for images. Lazy loading affects slide covers and focus images within a banner. It is recommended to disable this setting for banners that are in the visible browser window (when the page is first loaded). Typically, this affects banners at the beginning of a Shopping Experience.
