## Content: Set the Slide Selection

You can optionally set a **title** that will be displayed above the slider.

In the **Slide Selection**, you can set the slides and their order. The order can be changed either by drag & drop or through the quick actions. Individual slides can also be removed through the quick actions or the search results from the slide search. You will also find an edit function in the quick actions, which leads directly to the slide editing mask.

## Settings: General Slider Behavior

With **Rewind Slides**, the slider jumps back to the first slide when it reaches the last slide. Otherwise, the slider stays on the last slide and the "next slide" arrow symbol is hidden.

The **Show Overlay** option activates an overlay over the entire slider. This only covers the background and can improve the readability of texts.

With **Slides per View**, multiple slides can be displayed within a slider view. For example, only one slide can be displayed on a smartphone and three slides on a desktop.

The **Slide Speed** defines the time of the animation between the slides in milliseconds.

You can set the **Width of the Content Container**. This is especially useful for experience world layouts that span the entire screen width.
With **Page Content**, the maximum width of the container follows the width of the page content. With **Full Width**, the content container is displayed across the entire width.

### Auto-Play

Activates the auto-play of the slider. You can set the **Playback Interval** of the slider in milliseconds. For example, if you set 5000, it means that a slide is visible for 5 seconds before switching to the next slide. Auto-play is paused by default when you hover over the slider with the mouse. Auto-play takes into account the Rewind Slides setting.

## Sizes: Spacing and Aspect Ratio

Define the **Aspect Ratio** and thus determine the size of the slider. You can set a **maximum height** that the slider should not exceed. These settings are device-dependent and can be set separately for smartphone, tablet, and desktop.

A detailed guide on aspect ratio [can be found here](/en/guides/sizing-and-aspect-ratio)

## Navigation: Customize Quick Navigation
The **Show Slider Navigation** setting activates quick navigation. The **Position** can be **below** or **within** the slider. Under **Alignment**, the navigation points can be flexibly placed.

You can customize the **Appearance** of the navigation points. The **Shape** of the navigation points can be displayed either as a dot or a bar. There are three different **Sizes** available for the navigation points. You can also set the **Spacing** between the navigation points and their **Color**.

## Arrows: Customize Arrow Navigation
The **Show Slider Arrows** option activates arrow navigation. You can set the icon shape (chevron or arrow), color, and size. You can also define a background color for the arrow navigation.
