# Slide display and appearance
In this Tab you define display and appearance related settings for your slide.

## General settings

### Text alignment
Sets the text alignment of the content (heading, short description, button).

## Content Container
The Content Container is the box that holds the contents of the slide. In these settings you can define the appearance and behavior of this box.

### Vertical Container alignment
Sets the vertical alignment of the Content Container, relative to the slide.

### Background color
Sets the background color of the Content Container.

### Padding
Sets a spacing from the box border to the content. All CSS values like px or rem are allowed. Also you can set different values for the horizontal and vertical spacing by entering two values. The first value stands for the horizontal spacing and the second for the vertical spacing. So for example `10px 20px`.

### Limit container width
By default, the Content Container is displayed across the entire slide width. With **limit** enabled, the Content Container is limited in its width. You can then specify the horizontal alignment of the content container. You can set a maximum width of the Content Container. All CSS values like **px, rem or percent** are allowed. By default, the maximum width is 50%.

::: info Note
Mobile, the content container is always displayed across the full slide width. This setting only takes effect from the theme breakpoint **sm**.
