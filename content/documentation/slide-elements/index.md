# Slide elements

The Elysium Slider consists of two main components, the **Slide Elements** and the Shopping Experience Slider. In the Elide elements you define the content and appearance of individual slides. These are stored centrally in a separate administration module and can be reused as desired. You do not have to maintain individual slides within a shopping expierence layout.  
The slide management can be found under **Contents -> Elysium Slides**. Under [Setup](/documentation/setup) you will find the first steps.

Here we would like to give you a more detailed insight into the configurations of the Slide element.
