# Update notes

Important notes and tips on new versions

## Version 1.5.0

Besides optimizations for Shopware 6.5.x.x, this version focuses on the settings of the Elysium Slider shopping experience (CMS) element. The administration interface and code have been restructured and there are new options.
However, this has the consequence **that all settings from previous versions, per shopping experience (CMS) element, must be reset**.  
This **excludes the slide selection**, which will be preserved after an update. Other settings like **autoplay, navigation, slider arrows, etc...** have to be checked and possibly reset after an update.
