# Custom Slide Templates

You can set an individual Twig template for each slide, which you can freely customize in your custom theme or plugin. So if you have knowledge in Twig you can create individual templates for your slides, which can be reused as you like.

Under **Advanced** you can enter a name for your Twig template file. In the path below you have to create this file accordingly. This is best done within a custom theme or a plugin to be update safe. Not found template files will be ignored, so an error output will be suppressed.
