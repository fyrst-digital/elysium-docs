## Rewind slides
The slider jumps back to the first slide when it reaches the last slide. If this option is inactive, the slider stops at the last slide and the "next slide" arrow is hidden.

## Show Overlay
Shows an overlay over the entire slider, which overlays the background. This can improve the readability of the texts. If you optimize the slide background images yourself you can disable this option.

## Content Container width
Define the content container width.   
On <b>Page Content</b> the maximum width of the container follows the paqe content width.  
On <b>Full width</b> the content container is in full width.

## Slide speed
Defines the time of the anitmation between the slides in milliseconds.

## Auto-play
Activates the Auto-play of the slider. You can also set the playback interval of the slider in milliseconds. For example, if you set 5000 it means that a slide will be visible for 5 seconds before switching to the next slide. Auto-play is paused by default when you hover the mouse over the slider. Auto-play takes the **Rewind slides** setting into account.
