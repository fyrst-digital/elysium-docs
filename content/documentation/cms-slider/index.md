# Shopping expierence Slider element
The Elysium Slider consists of two modules, the Slide Elements and the **Shopping expierence Slider element**. In the Shopping expierence Slider you define a slide selection and the behavior and appearance of the slider. The slider element can be found in the block selection group **Text & Images** in the Shopping expierences Admin  pge.  
Under [Setup](/documentation/setup) you will find the setup and first steps.  

On the following pages we would like to give you a more detailed overview about the settings of the slider element.
