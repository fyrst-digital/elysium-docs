## Set multiple slides per slider view
In the Slider element, multiple slides can be set per slider. This setting is device-dependent and takes into account the settings of the last smaller screen size.  
So if you have set `1` slide per view on a smartphone, only one slide will be displayed across all devices. If you now set `2` slides on a tablet, two slides will be displayed on both the tablet and desktop.    
If this setting is not set, one slide will be displayed on all devices.
The same applies to the **Spacing between slides** option. The default value here is `0px`.

## Slide size with multiple slides
The slide size also depends on the aspect ratio when there are multiple slides per view. The aspect ratio always refers to a single slide and not the slider as a whole. The maximum height also refers to the individual slides.
